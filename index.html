        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a physicist with a background in mathematics,
             interested in symmetry, topology, and beyond-perturbative methods in many-body systems, from quantum condensed matter and statistical mechanics to high-energy physics. This is my personal website.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are running a CMT Journal Club on Wednesdays at 11am (intro talk) and 4pm (research talk) in the Schwinger lounge. Email me and I will add you to the email list.
        </p>
        <p> I am admin of the anomalology discord. Send me an email and I will send you an invite! We are running a regular zoom seminar every other tuesday. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEGKY_AoeEHr6K-tmCSloIA">Recordings can be found here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can contact me at first dot last at physics dot ucla dot edu and you can find me in Knudsen 6-137C.

        <h3>Recent and Upcoming</h3>
        <p>With Pierluigi Niro and Thomas Dumitrescu <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05366">we studied symmetry breaking by monopole condensation in Nf = 2 QED in 2+1D.</a>
        </p>
        <p> With Lei Gioia we <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10716">recently proved that the W-state is not the unique ground state of any local Hamiltonian</a>, for a precise but very flexible class of lattice Hamiltonians. I'm very fascinated by this groundstatability result, as it may constrain the search space for quantum ground states, and I know of no other result of this kind so far!
        </p>
        <p> With Arun Debray, Sanath K. Devalapurkar, Cameron Krulewski, Yu Leon Liu, Natalia Pacheco-Tallaj, we just posted <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16749">a new paper</a> on anomalies at domain walls, vortices, hedgehogs, etc. and a long exact sequence which encodes their matching with the bulk anomaly and higher Berry phase. I'm very excited about this work, and more to come from this interdisciplinary collaboration! You can hear me talk about some of it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzIs_He5JOk">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WU1TkzMz708">here</a> is another talk by Leon and Cam.
        </p>
        <p> I will be teaching a topics class on TQFT in the spring at UCLA.

        <p> <a href="https://www.romangeiko.com/main">Romain Geiko</a> has joined our (small) group as a postdoc!

        <h3>Things I'm Thinking About</h3>
        <p>
            New kinds of gapless topological states and phase transitions between topological phases.

            <a href="https://experience-lab.github.io/cellular-automata/">The background of this page</a>
                draws a randomly selected 5-state cellular automata, where a pixel's state depends only on the average of 
                 the previous state of itself and its two neighbors. There are 5^13 such rules.

            excited to have found some scale invariant criticality in the wild! My hair is not as
