            I'm a physicist with a background in mathematics,
             interested in symmetry, topology, and non-perturbative methods in many-body systems, from high energy to condensed matter.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am now joining the UCLA physics department!

        <h3>Recent and Upcoming</h3>
        <p>
            The school and workshop on global categorical symmetries has concluded, and you can find the <a href="https://pirsa.org/">videos of talks here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            With R. Verresen, U. Borla, T. Rakovsky, S. Moroz, and A. Vishwanath we are finishing a work showing how the 
            Higgs phase of a gauge theory is naturally an SPT. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01376">Here is the preprint of volume I!</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08136">And here is volume II!</a>

        <h3>Things I'm Thinking About</h3>
        <p>
            Higgs-SPT ideas in non-abelian gauge theories and superconductors.
        </p>
        <p>
            The "self-dual" critical point in the Fradkin-Shenker phase diagram.
        </p>
        <p>
            Experimental observation of higher Berry phases.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Quantum cellular automata" and how they relate to gapped phases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mixed state or "average" SPTs.

        <h3>Other Stuff</h3>
        <p>
            Every now and then I feel inspired to make some math and physics visualization,
             <a href="https://experience-lab.github.io/">some of which you can find here.</a> 
             In particular, <a href="https://experience-lab.github.io/cellular-automata/">the background of this page,</a>
                 which draws a randomly selected 5-state cellular automata, where a pixel's state depends only on the average of 
                 the previous state of itself and its two neighbors. There are 5^13 such rules.

            This website is open source, and you can <a href="https://github.com/ryan-thorngren/ryan-thorngren.github.io">find the code on github</a>.

            <a href="/me-and-dune.jpg">Here is a picture of me</a> on a sand dune in Death Valley, 
            excited to have found some scale invariant criticality in the wild! My hair is not as 
            long now :)
