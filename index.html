        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a physicist with a background in mathematics,
             interested in symmetry, topology, and non-perturbative methods in many-body systems, from quantum condensed matter and statistical mechanics to high-energy physics. This is my personal website. A group website is in progress!
        </p>
        <p>
            I have just joined the UCLA physics department! You can find me in Knudsen 137C.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://scgcs.berkeley.edu/">I am part of the Simons Collaboration on Global Categorical Symmetries.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            You can contact me at first dot last at physics dot ucla dot edu. Send me an email and I will add you to the anomalology discord!

        <h3>Recent and Upcoming</h3>
        <p> With Arun Debray, Sanath K. Devalapurkar, Cameron Krulewski, Yu Leon Liu, Natalia Pacheco-Tallaj, we just posted <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16749">a new paper</a> on anomalies at domain walls, vortices, hedgehogs, etc. and a long exact sequence which encodes their matching with the bulk anomaly and higher Berry phase. I'm very excited about this work, and more to come from this interdisciplinary collaboration!
        </p>
        <p> I am teaching Ph231a in the Fall, which will be about complex analysis, differential equations, asymptotics and perturbation theory, a bit of differential topology, and other fun stuff.
        </p>
        <p> <a href="https://www.romangeiko.com/main">Romain Geiko</a> has joined our (small) group as a postdoc!
        </p>
        <p>
            With R. Verresen, U. Borla, T. Rakovsky, S. Moroz, and A. Vishwanath we are finishing a work showing how the 
            Higgs phase of a gauge theory is naturally an SPT. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01376">Here is the preprint of volume I!</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08136">And here is volume II!</a>

        <h3>Things I'm Thinking About</h3>
        <p>
            Higgs-SPT ideas in non-abelian gauge theories and superconductors.
        </p>
        <p>
            The "self-dual" critical point in the Fradkin-Shenker phase diagram.
        </p>
        <p>
            Higher Berry phases and their experimental realization.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Quantum cellular automata" and how they relate to gapped phases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mixed state or "average" SPTs.
        </p>

        <h3>Other Stuff</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://experience-lab.github.io/cellular-automata/">The background of this page</a>
                draws a randomly selected 5-state cellular automata, where a pixel's state depends only on the average of 
                 the previous state of itself and its two neighbors. There are 5^13 such rules.

            <a href="/me-and-dune.jpg">Here is a picture of me</a> on a sand dune in Death Valley, 
            excited to have found some scale invariant criticality in the wild! My hair is not as 
            long now :)
