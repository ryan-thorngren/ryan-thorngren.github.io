            I'm a physicist with a background in mathematics,
             interested in symmetry, topology, 
             and other universal properties of many-body systems, from high energy to condensed matter.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently at the KITP in Santa Barbara, in the northwest corner on the second floor. 
            Next year I will be a junior faculty at the IHES in France.

        <h3>Recent and Upcoming</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://scgcs.berkeley.edu/gcs2022-conference-and-school/">From June 6 - 17 there will be a school and workshop on global categorical symmetries</a>
             at the Perimeter Institute. You can still register to participate online and there should hopefully be some recordings 
             once it's done. Come learn what categorical symmetries are all about! Or help us figure out what they're about!
        </p>

            With R. Verresen, U. Borla, T. Rakovsky, S. Moroz, and A. Vishwanath we are finishing a work showing how the 
            Higgs phase of a gauge theory is naturally an SPT. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11vWx0H-PKs">You can hear Ruben speak about it here.</a>

        <h3>Things I'm Thinking About</h3>
        <p>
            What does it mean for gapless systems to have edge modes?
            Are there bulk invariants that can detect them?
        </p>
        <p>
            How can we leverage measurement and feedback to produce interesting quantum states?
        </p>
        <p>
            How do we describe "self-dual" critical points such as in the Fradkin-Shenker phase diagram?
        </p>
        <p>
            What are the observable consequences of higher Berry phase?
        </p>
        <p>
            What are the categorical symmetries of 3d TQFT? Is there an extension theory of fusion categories? How do we understand bulk-boundary correspondence for 1-form symmetries and their generalizations? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Related to the above, are QCAs trivial in the realm of local Hamiltonian evolution? Is there "quantum" L-theory?
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes I shout other random ideas into the void at @ranglelangle.

        <h3>Other Stuff</h3>
        <p>
            Every now and then I feel inspired to make some math and physics visualization,
             <a href="https://experience-lab.github.io/">some of which you can find here.</a> 
             In particular, <a href="https://experience-lab.github.io/cellular-automata/">the background of this page.</a>

            <a href="/me-and-dune.jpg">Here is a picture of me</a> on a sand dune in Death Valley, 
            excited to have found some scale invariant criticality in the wild! My hair is not as 
            long now :)
